The look and feel is vibrant and inviting. The website is created as to be userfriendly, easy to navigate, and provide a multisensory learning experience
to cater for a variety of different learning styles.

### _User Stories_
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Not enough phonics resources freely available onlinePart of curriculum to incorporate ICT and active learning in the classroom and at home.
