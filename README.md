## UX

This website was designed as an interactive educational tool for both teachers and parents to help children learn the initial phonics sounds. 
The look and feel is vibrant and inviting. The website is created as to be userfriendly, easy to navigate, and provide a multisensory learning experience
to cater for a variety of different learning styles.

### _User Stories_
- As a teacher, I would like to have access to an interactive learning platform that would allow me to incorporate ICT and active learning within the classroom. 

- As a teacher, there are not enough phonics resources freely available online that incorporate a multisensory approach to phonics.

- As a teacher, I would like to show children that learning can be fun and enjoyable.

- As a parent, my child like to play games after school on my tablet and I would like if there were more games that included learning aspects to enhance my child's development.

- As a parent, I would like to engage more with my child's learning experience but I do not have the correct knowledge of how theses topics are meant to be taught.

- As a teacher, I would like to strengthen the consistency of schoool and home learning.

- As a parent, I would like to access learning activities for my child that are accessible on multiple device types.

### _Strategy Plane_
 - The aim of the project was to develop a interactive phonics game as an educational tool to help children learn knowledge of the letter sounds. It was designed to be user friendly,
 easy to navigate and achieved the purpose it was created for, learning initial phonics sounds and the words associated with these sounds. It was extremely important that it also
 adopted a multisensory approach so that no matter what the learning style or abilities of the user, it had an element that helped them to grasp an understanding of phonics and aided them intheir learning process.
 For this reason it was essential to include audio, visual and written elements within the game.

### _Scope Plane_
- The priority for this game was to make sure the game worked well, was easy to use and comprehend, achieved the learning outcomes of the phonics curriculum and that all elements 
were executed to the best of my ability. Given my time frame and skills, I decided to focus on the first two units of the initial phonics sounds aimed at junior infant age range. 
This includes the letters: T, A, S, M, I, H, C, K, O, P, L, E, and G. The design would be a one page website with an inviting and vibrant homepage with minimal text, a game section that would include 
questions(letters) and 4 choices for each question using images as the choices and the choice words underneath each picture, it would also include a results section where 
the user would be able to see the result they achieved on completion of the game and an option to obtain a certificate with their name and score at the end of the game, or
if they wish, they could restart the game with the intention of learning and improving with each attempt.
The idea of the certificate was as a reward element for users that they could print out if they wish. As the website is aimed at children it was importnat to make sure it easy to
read, easy to navigate and the instructions were clear and easily accessible at any point in the game.
- When it comes to learning, it is crucial to create a platform that caters for all different learning abilities and styles, which is why it was essential that it was a multisensory
game which includes auditory, visual, written and interactive elements. The choices were designed as images that could be clicked instead of inserting radio buttons, a button is included so 
users can hear the letter sound as well as see the letter as it would be written(in both upper and lower cases) and underneath the images text that revals the word that each picture represents.

### _Structure Plane_
- The structure of the website was designed to be inviting, vibrant and visually attractive to users. There is minimal text used and plenty of
vivid imagery to capture the attention of the user. The homepage is bright and includes a simple and straightforward navigation bar,
a full view height background image, a callout to give a brief introduction and tell the user the purpose of the website and a large glowing button
that draws the attention of the user and invites them to begin the game. The game itself is mainly structured using clear and vibrant images as well as 
brief text on what the user has to do, these images are clickable which encourages interactivity and enhance visual interpretation skills. The audio elements 
provided at the click of a button. The has a clear description of it's purpose and allows the usser to hear how the letter sounds when spoken.
- On completion of the game, a results page is displayed which includes a simple form for the user to complete if they wish to generate a certificate and two
other buttons that allow the user to restart the game or exit the game if they wish. The instructions are always available on the navbar which is viewable at
any stage of the game, and are displayed through a pop up scrollable modal.
The certificate is an extra additon which will allow the user to generate a certificate showing their name and the score they received.

### Skeleton Plane
- It is a one page website with a separate page for the certificate that is generated at the end of the game. It includes 3 different sections,
when each section is displayed the other sections are hidden until they need to be accessed.
These sections are as follows:
- Homepage Section
- Game Section
- Results Section
- Certificate (if the user wishes to generate a certificate after the game is completed)

#### Wireframes mockups
- [Wireframes](wireframes/wireframes_alldevices.pdf)
- The initial design for this site has always been the same, simple but vibrant and inviting website with lots of vivid imagery
, many calls to action, minimal text and easy access to information at any time for ease of use for the user.

### Surface Plane
#### Colours
- The colours chosen for this project were based on research of colours that best facilitate children's ability to learn.
Blue is described as unerverally the best colour to use in learning activities as it can enhance reading compreshension, it is also 
a calming and relaxing colour and lighter shades create a lighter and positive vibe. Blue drives productivity, it is ideal for highly cognitive 
and challenging tasks.
Yellow is a vibrant colour and is shown to grab and maintain children's attention while learning. It generates positive energy and encourages creativity.
- Other colours I have chosen to use are red and green. Red stimulates energy and green promotes a feeling of relaxation and ease.

#### Typography
- When choosing the typography for this project, I consulted with my sister who is a primary school teacher to get advice on the best typography to use
when it comes to learning for children. It was important that the text was inviting and visually appealing with an easy to read typeface. In light of this
advice, I decided to use 'Fredoka One' for the headers and buttons and 'Sniglet' for the body text.

#### Images
- The images for this project were obtained from a couple of different resources. The letter images for each question in the game were sourced from [TeachersPayTeachers.com](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Large-Alphabet-Flash-Cards-Capital-Lowercase-1137338?st=1c42baaf6b98ba8c603c374104b2be5b)

## Features

### Homepage
- The homepage consists of a fixed navigation bar that includes a logo to the left which acts as a link back to the homepage, and three navigation links
to the right. These links are 'Instructions', 'Play', and 'Exit'. The instructions link when clicked opens up a pop up scrollable modal, which displays the step 
by step instructions of how the game is to be played. The play link allows the user to start the quiz and the exit link acts as means to exit the game at any point 
and return to the homepage, this includes an alert when clicked, that asks the user if they are sure they want to exit the game, incase this button was pressed by 
accident they have the ability to cancel the exit request or confirm it.
