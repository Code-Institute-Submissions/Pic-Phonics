# Pic Phonics
## Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend development
---
## Project Description
This project is a multisensory phonics game developed for children, designed to incorporate a visual, auditory, and interactive learning experience.
The idea was developed as an educational tool for both parents and teachers in order to provide an interactive platform for learning phonics that is simple , easy to access, use and understand. It should help children to
develop their reading comprehension and understanding of the relationship between written letters and spoken words. This game will encourage decoding, reading and writing skills for children of all language abilities.
The game focuses on initial phonics aimed at chidren between the ages of 3 to 6, with plans to expand it to include options for different levels to allow children to prgress with the learning experience.
This project combines technology with education in line with the primary school curriculum in Ireland, to incorporate ICT through active learning that makes the experience fun and engaging for children, providing a positive
experience. Technology is a huge part of society today and children encounter technology at a very young age so it is important to utilise technology to encouage learning and understand that it can be used as a positive resource in
a child's development. It can be a powerful tool in developing life skills.

### _Business Objectives_

2. Assist with children's understanding of the connection between written letter and spoken words.
3. Provide the necessary resources to allow them to read unfamiliar words by themselves.
4. Provide a link between unfamiliar print words to their spoken language.
5. Help young readers develop their reading comprehension skills.
6. Offer an interactive platform for phonics education thats simple, easy to understand and access.
7. Encourage parent/child engagement in early learning.
8. Provide an easily accessible platform that parents can utilise at home to support their child's learning.
9. To support teachers to bridge the gap between school and home learning.
10. Incorporate Information & Communications Technology(ICT) through active learning.


### _Consumer Objectives_
1. For children to have fun and enjoyable experience while learning.
2. Useful resource to bring ICT elements into the classroom.
3. Create consistency between school and home learning.
4. Provide knowledge to parents of classroom learning concepts.
5. Increase parents engagement in the child's learning experience.
6. Access to a learning resource that can be used on a variety of different devices.

3. Additional resources such as reading materials(access to e-books), songs, rhymes, stories etc.
4. Including other activities to the platform such as fill in the blanks and audio games to guess the sound/word.
5. Create a forum space where parents and teachers can discuss phonics and ask questions.
6. Ability to set up a user account to track and keep a record of progress made.

## UX

This website was designed as an interactive educational tool for both teachers and parents to help children learn the initial phonics sounds. 
The look and feel is vibrant and inviting. The website is created as to be userfriendly, easy to navigate, and provide a multisensory learning experience
to cater for a variety of different learning styles.

### _User Stories_
- As a teacher, I would like to have access to an interactive learning platform that would allow me to incorporate ICT and active learning within the classroom. 

- As a teacher, there are not enough phonics resources freely available online that incorporate a multisensory approach to phonics.

- As a teacher, I would like to show children that learning can be fun and enjoyable.

- As a teacher, I would like to see more interactive learning that incorporates aspects to fit individual learning needs.

- As a parent, my child like to play games after school on my tablet and I would like if there were more games that included learning aspects to enhance my child's development.

- As a parent, in the middle of a pandemic, with all the schools closed, I would like to engage more with my child's learning experience but I do not have the correct knowledge of how theses topics are meant to be taught.

- As a teacher, I would like to strengthen the consistency of schoool and home learning.

- As a parent, I would like to access learning activities for my child that are accessible on multiple device types.

### _Strategy Plane_
 - The aim of the project was to develop a interactive phonics game as an educational tool to help children learn knowledge of the letter sounds. It was designed to be user friendly,
 easy to navigate and achieved the purpose it was created for, learning initial phonics sounds and the words associated with these sounds. It was extremely important that it also
 adopted a multisensory approach so that no matter what the learning style or abilities of the user, it had an element that helped them to grasp an understanding of phonics and aided them intheir learning process.
 For this reason it was essential to include audio, visual and written elements within the game.

### _Scope Plane_
- The priority for this game was to make sure the game worked well, was easy to use and comprehend, achieved the learning outcomes of the phonics curriculum and that all elements 
were executed to the best of my ability. Given my time frame and skills, I decided to focus on the first two units of the initial phonics sounds aimed at junior infant age range. 
This includes the letters: T, A, S, M, I, H, C, K, O, P, L, E, and G. The design would be a one page website with an inviting and vibrant homepage with minimal text, a game section that would include 
questions(letters) and 4 choices for each question using images as the choices and the choice words underneath each picture, it would also include a results section where 
the user would be able to see the result they achieved on completion of the game and an option to obtain a certificate with their name and score at the end of the game, or
if they wish, they could restart the game with the intention of learning and improving with each attempt.
The idea of the certificate was as a reward element for users that they could print out if they wish. As the website is aimed at children it was importnat to make sure it easy to
read, easy to navigate and the instructions were clear and easily accessible at any point in the game.
- When it comes to learning, it is crucial to create a platform that caters for all different learning abilities and styles, which is why it was essential that it was a multisensory
game which includes auditory, visual, written and interactive elements. The choices were designed as images that could be clicked instead of inserting radio buttons, a button is included so 
users can hear the letter sound as well as see the letter as it would be written(in both upper and lower cases) and underneath the images text that revals the word that each picture represents.

### _Structure Plane_
- The structure of the website was designed to be inviting, vibrant and visually attractive to users. There is minimal text used and plenty of
vivid imagery to capture the attention of the user. The homepage is bright and includes a simple and straightforward navigation bar,
a full view height background image, a callout to give a brief introduction and tell the user the purpose of the website and a large glowing button
that draws the attention of the user and invites them to begin the game. The game itself is mainly structured using clear and vibrant images as well as 
brief text on what the user has to do, these images are clickable which encourages interactivity and enhance visual interpretation skills. The audio elements 
provided at the click of a button. The has a clear description of it's purpose and allows the usser to hear how the letter sounds when spoken.
- On completion of the game, a results page is displayed which includes a simple form for the user to complete if they wish to generate a certificate and two
other buttons that allow the user to restart the game or exit the game if they wish. The instructions are always available on the navbar which is viewable at
any stage of the game, and are displayed through a pop up scrollable modal.
The certificate is an extra additon which will allow the user to generate a certificate showing their name and the score they received.

### Skeleton Plane
It is a one page website with a separate page for the certificate that is generated at the end of the game. It includes 3 different sections,
when each section is displayed the other sections are hidden until they need to be accessed.
These sections are as follows:
- Homepage Section
- Game Section
- Results Section
- Certificate (if the user wishes to generate a certificate after the game is completed)

#### Wireframes mockups
- [Wireframes](wireframes/wireframes_alldevices.pdf)
- The initial design for this site has always been the same, simple but vibrant and inviting website with lots of vivid imagery
, many calls to action, minimal text and easy access to information at any time for ease of use for the user.

### Surface Plane
#### Colours
- The colours chosen for this project were based on research of colours that best facilitate children's ability to learn.
Blue is described as unerverally the best colour to use in learning activities as it can enhance reading compreshension, it is also 
a calming and relaxing colour and lighter shades create a lighter and positive vibe. Blue drives productivity, it is ideal for highly cognitive 
and challenging tasks.
Yellow is a vibrant colour and is shown to grab and maintain children's attention while learning. It generates positive energy and encourages creativity.
- Other colours I have chosen to use are red and green. Red stimulates energy and green promotes a feeling of relaxation and ease.

#### Typography
- When choosing the typography for this project, I consulted with my sister who is a primary school teacher to get advice on the best typography to use
when it comes to learning for children. It was important that the text was inviting and visually appealing with an easy to read typeface. In light of this
advice, I decided to use 'Fredoka One' for the headers and buttons and 'Sniglet' for the body text.

#### Images
- The images for this project were obtained from a couple of different resources. The letter images for each question in the game were sourced from [TeachersPayTeachers.com](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Large-Alphabet-Flash-Cards-Capital-Lowercase-1137338?st=1c42baaf6b98ba8c603c374104b2be5b)
- The images for the choice options in the game were obtained from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)
- The background image for the containers was sourced from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) 

## Features
### Navigation Bar & Footer
The navigation bar is in a fixed position to make it easy for users to access the navigation elements of the website and allow them to view and access these at any point during or after the game.
The navbar consists of a logo to the left which acts as a link back to the homepage, and three navigation links to the right. These links are 'Instructions', 'Play', and 'Exit'.logo text to the left 
which acts as a link to the homepage. The navbar is responsive and the navigation menu collapses into a hamburger menu for both tablet and mobile devices. The footer is fixed at the bottom and contains 
copyright information located in the center. 

### Homepage
- The homepage consists of  The instructions link when clicked opens up a pop up scrollable modal, which displays the step 
by step instructions of how the game is to be played. The play link allows the user to start the quiz and the exit link acts as means to exit the game at any point 
and return to the homepage, this includes an alert when clicked, that asks the user if they are sure they want to exit the game, incase this button was pressed by 
accident they have the ability to cancel the exit request or confirm it. 
- There is a full width height, responsive image. It is a bright but subtle background image with a callout which is the title of the website and a brief introduction to the purpose of the website.
- Directly under the callout there is a large button 'Let's Play' which is styled to glow to draw  the attention of the user and when clicked takes the user to the 
game section where the game begins.

### Game Section
- The game opens immediately when either the 'Let's Play' button or the 'Play' link on the navigation bar is clicked. The game section has the same background image as the homepage but with a blue container for the questions and answers.
- The game container includes a scorebox where the users score is tracked, a brief sentence stating which letter this question refers to, an image of the letter in both upper and lower cases and adjacent to this is a yellow button 'Click for Letter Sound'
is placed. This button, once clicked, allows the user to hear the sound of the letter using an audio clip. This functions as an auditory element to aid with linking the written letter with the spoken language.
- The choices section comprises of a brief statement alerting users to what they must do to select an answer. Then the user is presented with 4 images, these are the choices that they will selct an answer from. The images are responsive and display as a 2 
column display on larger screens and one column display on smaller devices such as phones. These images have been programmed to be clickable.
Once a user has selcted an option, they will receive an alert which will be either a 'correct' alert or an 'incorrect' alert. Both alerts feature encouraging messages, so that the user not matter what choice they make will not be discouraged to continue. This is a learning process
so it is essential to make the user feel at ease and supported through the process.
- After the answer has been selected, the corresponding words for each image will be revealed to the user for a few seconds to give them a chance to see the words associated with each picture in writing. I chose to hide the text until an answer was selected, as
the written text will give the answer away and defeat the learning outcomes. 
- I have programmed a set timeout function to give the user time to view the text before the next question is displayed on the screen.
- When all questions have been answered and the game has come to a close, a 'Submit' button appears at the end of the container that will give the user the ability to submit their choices to receive a total score in percentage format.

### Results Section
- The results section is displayed once the 'Submit' button has been clicked. This consists of the same background image on the homepage with a title 'Results'
and directly underneath this, the user result is displayed. The result is shown as follows: "You have scored 70% in the Pic Phonics Initial Sounds Game".
- Below this is a form container coloured blue that includes 2 input values: 'First Name' and 'Last Name', these inputs are required if the user decides they would like to generate a certificate of their results. This form is validated so the user will not be able to select the 'Get Certificate'
button if these input fields are empty.
- In order to generate a certificate of their results I have included a 'Get Certificate' button below the input fields, which has been programmed to get the input values inserted and the user's scoore and displayed this on a separate html document created in the form of a certificate.
- Another feature that is included in the results section are two buttons displayed at the end of the container: One called 'Exit' and the other called 'Restart Game'.
- The 'Exit' button when clicked will trigger an alert that will ask the user if they are sure they would like to leave the game. The alert then contains a cancel button and a confirm button. If the user confirms they would like to leave the game, then they will be taken directly back to the homepage.
- The 'Restart Game' button when clicked, will take the user back to the beginning of the game and will display the game container and first question, this will also prompt the score to reset.

### Certificate
- The certificate element of the game was designed to create a personalised certificate for each user and is populated using the input fields in the result section to identify and obtain the user's name and the user score that the user receives in the game is 
also populated into the certificate html file. 
- The user can then save this certificate as a pdf or can be printed directly from the browser, if the user wishes to do so.
- The certificate contains the company name, the user name, the name of the game, the score and the company logo.

## Existing Features

#### General
- The navigation bar is displayed as a fixed top element, and is located at the top of the page at all times for each section. 
- The navigation links are easily accessible and contain the company logo text as a link to the homepage on the far left side of the navigation bar and three navigation links to right hand side with links 'Instructions', 'Play' and 'Exit'.
- The instructions link opens a pop up scrollable modal dialog box containing the instruction for how to play the game, the play link takes the user to the beginning of the game and the exit link opens an alert asking if they want to leave 
and includes a cancel and confirm button in the alert. If the user clicks cancel it will close the alert and if the user clicks yes to confirm, it directs the user back to the homepage.
- The footer is fixed at the bottom of the screen and contains copyright information displayed in the center of the footer.

### Homepage
- The homepage is designed with a full width height hero image of letter blocks with an opaque overlay, a callout that provides a brief introduction to the user about the purpose of the game and a large glowing button labeled 'Let's Play', that draws the attention of the user
and once clicked starts the game by taking the user to the game section and displaying the first question.

### Game Section
- The game section is a container that has a score container which is full width at the top which displays the user's score throughout the game. Undernath this there is a statement that declares which letter is being shown in the image directly below it. This image is located within 
a three column display with the first column empty, the second column containing the letter image in both upper and lower case and the third column holds the audio button ' Click to hear letter sound'. This button when pressed allows the user to hear audio of their
letter sound spoken.
- Underneath this, is the question container, which is a brief description in text, telling the user what is required to answer the question.
- The answers container is displayed below this which contains 4 images. It is designed using four columns, one per image, each 50% width of the game container. On larger screens it will be displayed showing 2 images side by side on top and 2 images side by side on the bottom, a grid of four images.
On smaller screens the images are displayed in a one column block formation one after the other. The answers were designed as radio buttons with the image, input and span text wrapped inside a label tag and using CSS the radioo button element was hidden. This allows the image to act as a radio button,
when the image is clicked, the radio button element is also checked.
- When a user selects an answer by clicking an image, the span text revealing the item in the image in text format, there is a brief timeout set and then the next question is displayed automatically. If the user selects the correct answer, they will receive an alert, and also a score of 1 will be added to the score box at the top of the game container.
- If the user selects the incorrect answer, they will also receive an alert, however no score points will be added to the score container. Both alerts contain positive feedback messages encouraging the user to continue in the game.
- At the final question, after the user selects an answer, a 'Submit' button is displayed at the end of the game container. This when clicked, will take the user directly to the results section of the website.

### Results Section
- The results section has a background container that displays the same background image as the homepage, with a section header 'Result' displayed at the top of the page. Directly underneath this, there is a brief statement telling the user the overall result they scored, in percentage format from the game. This statement is 'You have scored 70% in the
Pic Phonics Initial Sounds Game'
- Below this is a form container that has a sub-heading stating that the user can fill in their details if they wish to generate a certificate for their game results. This form has two input fields: 'First Name' and 'Last Name' and a 'Get Certificate' submit button. This button is only functional if the user completes both input fields, otherwsie they will 
be prompted to complete each field in order to generate the certificate. If they input fields are filled in correctly then the 'Get Certificate' button when pressed will take the user directly to the certificate page, which will open in a blank tab for user convenience. This certificate is populated with the user input name and the score they received.
- Also include in the results section at the bottom of the section, is a 2 button grid that contains a 'Exit Game' button and a 'Restart Game' button. The 'Exit Game' button, if selected will create a pop up alert asking the user if they wish to leave the game. The user has a choice to cancel the request by selecting the cancel button on the alert, or the choice 
to confirm the request by selecting the 'yes' button on the alert. Upon confirmation to leave the game, the user will be taken directly back to the homepage. The 'Restart Game' button, if selected will automatically reset the game container, which will clear the previous score and begin the game again by displaying game container and the first question in the game.

### Certificate
The certificate is a separate html file created and designed to display as a certificate specifically for the game. It is populated using Javascript local storage to store the user input values in the form container in the results section and also obtain the user score results.
The input values are stored using local storage and a separate Javascript file was created to get these items and display them in the certifcate html.
The certificate is a personalised addition to the game which will show the users name and their individual score each time they want to generate a certificate for their result.
The certificate is optional for users and is only displayed if the user decides they wish to complete the form in the results container and after they have selected the 'Get Certificate' button underneath the form inputs.

## Features Left to Implement

- Additional Phonics sounds - other levels
- Additional educational learning games
- Able to select different level functions

## Technologies Used
### Languages
- HTML5: This was used to create the structure for both the main page and the certificate that is generated at the end of the game.
- CSS: This was used to style all elements of the website
- JavaScript: This was used extensively to create the game section of the website

### Frameworks/Integrations
- Bootstrap4: Used for the grid layout for the website
- Font Awesome: Used to add icons to my footer and sections of the website
- Google Fonts: Used to select the font styles used on the website for the section heading and body.
- JQuery: Used for the dropdown navigation and also for the modal created to display the game instructions.
- SweetAlert2: Used to create the alerts for 'correct' and 'incorrect' responses within the game and also as an alert when the user decides to leave the game,
asking them if they are sure before executing the exitGame function.

### Workspace
- GitHub: - (IDE) Integrated Development Environment
- Gitpod: - Cloud based hosting platform for managing my repositories, tracking changes and storing files.

### Other
- Tinyjpeg: This was used to compress the images used on the website.
- Balsamiq Wireframes: Used to create wireframes for this project

## Testing
*_ Validation W3C HTML Markup Validator_*
- Ran code through the HTML validator and it was displaying an error with using a a tag with a button type so I changed the html file to make the nav link an a tag and removed type = button.
The 'Let's Play' button was showing the same error so I removed the a tag and left it as a button tag which resolved both issues.
- The other error that was showing up was that there was no source for the image tags. The src attributes for the image tags in the html document were being allocated from the Javascript file.
I did some research on this and found a solution on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30658663/bad-value-for-attribute-src-on-element-img-must-be-non-empty-for-dynamically) and 
added a '#' to the src in the html which is then populated with the correct image source from the Javascript file.
- I ran my updated code back through the HTML validator and I found no errors.

W3C CSS Validator
- I ran my CSS code through the validator and it found no errors.

JSHint
- When I first ran my Javascript code through JS Hint, it showed a few errors with unused variables, so I removed any unnecessary variables that were still in my code and these eroors were rectified.
The other error that was showing up was an undefined variable for the Swal variable used in my sweet alert messages.
